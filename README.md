# [Use The Bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=646954861249691650&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## üíª Repository Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to allow anyone who wants to contribute to  the bot to fork the repo. This repository also allows me to document changes and updates to the bot. In the future, I might use this repo to host a site for the bot.

## üìÅ Files
bot.py: The main file I use for the discord bot. It is constantly being worked on. I do not use an IDE or text editor connected to Github and I certainly do not use Github for altering the code. Since this is the case, there's only one branch and commits are literal copy and pastes of my entire code.

profanewordslist.txt: This list contains profane words for the bot command `$cussmod`. I filter through this list and censor profanity with Python string functions.

### üìÉ Files you'd see if you actually tested the bot
nonickguilds.txt: A list of guilds that used `$nickstop` to stop the bot from changing nicknames\
profmodchannels.txt: A list of channels that used `$cussmod` to allow the bot to censor profanity in that channel.

## üìë Bot Commands

### üî® Moderation ( Commands only work with permissions)
` $cussmod ` This allows the bot to censor profanity on the channel the message is sent at.\
` $cussmodstop ` Disables profanity moderation.\
` $nickstart ` Enables the bot to change nicknames when checks are failed.\
` $nickstop ` Disables the bot's ability to change nicknames when checks are failed.\
` $vibekick @user ` Kicks a user depending on a vibe check. This command is only for comedic purposes and not very practical. Returns an error if mentions are left blank.

### ‚ùî Help
` $help ` Brings up a list of vibe check bot commands ( This command has several 'sub commands' visible when called )

### ‚úîÔ∏è Checks
` $vibecheckonline ` Vibe checks a user from a list of online users.\
` $vibecheckrandom ` Vibe checks regardless of Discord status.\
` $vibecheck @user ` Vibe checks mentioned user. If mentions are left blank, the bot vibe checks the command author.\
` $vibecheckpercent @user ` Returns a percentage of how much a mentioned user is 'vibin'. If mentions are left empty, see above.\
` $factcheck (content) ` This command is poking fun at Instagram's new fact-check feature. It copies a few of the same fact-checkers as well. When called, the command returns whether or not (content) is True or False.

### üî† Other

` $wholesome ` Pulls wholesome memes from Reddit.\
